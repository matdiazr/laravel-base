Docker: 
    Docker-Compose ERROR: 
        Couldn’t connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://<DOCKER_HOST> — is it running?
    Fix:
        Simple solution is running with sudo 

        If you want to run the command without prefixing it every time with sudo do like that (as written here):

        1. Create the docker group: $ sudo groupadd docker
        2. Add your user to the docker group:$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
        3. Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.
